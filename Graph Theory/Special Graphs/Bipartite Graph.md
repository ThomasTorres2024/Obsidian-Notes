# Bipartite Graph Definition
A [[Bipartite Graph]] is a type of [[Graph]], $G=\{ V,E\}$ where $V=V_{1} \cup V_{2}$ such that for $x,y \in V_{1}$ $\not \exists (x,y) \in E$ and for $x,y \in V_{2}$ $\not \exists (x,y) \in E$. This is to say that the [[Graph]] can be separated into 2 separate portions, where each portion has no node that connects to itself. Visually we can see this in the following red and blue sets of vertices:
