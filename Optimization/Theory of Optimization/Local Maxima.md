# Local Maxima 
The [[Local Maxima]] of a function, $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, tells us that over some region, $D$, we have that the [[Local Maxima]], $x^*$ satisfies that:
$$f(x^*) \geq f(x), \forall x \in D$$
Note that $x^*$ is not necessarily unique, as a function may have multiple local maxima.
