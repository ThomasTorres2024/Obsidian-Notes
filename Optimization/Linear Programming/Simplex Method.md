# Simplex Method
The [[Simplex Method]] is a method for finding the extrema of a [[Linear Programming]] problem where the objective function is linear and the constraint sets are linear. It is almost always the case that in our constraint set, we restrict ourselves to the first quadrant/octant etc. 

Graphically, we can think of letting our objective function $f$, stretch over the feasible region by considering various [[Contour]]s of $f$ (e.g for $f(x,y)=z$, let $z=k$, a constant). 

Let us consider the following problem,
