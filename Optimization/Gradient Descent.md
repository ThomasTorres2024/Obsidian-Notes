# Gradient Descent Overview
Gradient Descent is a method used to obtain the local minimum of a function by continually iterating in the direction of the lowest descent. 

We can determine the convergence of the [[Gradient Descent]] algorithm by considering the smallest and largest eigen values of the Hessian of a function.
