# Vector Field Definition
A vector field is a function $\vec{F}:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ defined by:
$$\vec{F}=A_{1}\vec{e}_{1}+A_{2}\vec{e}_{2}+\cdots+A_{n}\vec{e}_{n}$$
Where each $A_{i}$ is a function with respect to $x,y$.

For the case where $\vec{F}:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ we get:
$$\vec{F}=M\hat{i}+N\hat{j}$$
Where $M=M(x,y)$ and $N=N(x,y)$. Every point in the plane has an associated vector. Some examples of vector fields include wind maps, say a hurricane map in the Golf of Mexico or winds off of a coast.

Force fields, velocity in fluid fields, and gravity fields are some other real life examples of vector fields.

# Vector Fields in $\mathbb{R}^3$
A vector field in 3 dimensions is defined $\vec{F}=\langle P,Q,R \rangle$.

Some vector fields include:
1. A gravitational field dragging objects to the origin, which is the source point of gravity from all points along $\mathbb{R}^3$, has the inverse square law, as we go further out our gravitational 
2. An electric field which behaves analogously to the gravitational field and attracts oppositely charged particles to the center 
3. [[Gradient Field]]s which are the [[Gradient]] of a multivariable function $f(x,y,z)$
