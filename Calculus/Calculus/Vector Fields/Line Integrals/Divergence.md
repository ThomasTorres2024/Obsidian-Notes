# Divergence Definition
The divergence, with components of a [[Vector Field]], $\vec{F}=\langle P, Q\rangle$, is given by:
$$\text{div}(\vec{F})=P_{x}+Q_{y}$$
The divergence measures how much things are diverging in a vector field. We can interpret divergence of a vector field as how much our flow is expanding. 

If we have positive divergence, we see that a fluid is expanding within a region, and if we have a negative divergence, we see that fluid is entering a system.
