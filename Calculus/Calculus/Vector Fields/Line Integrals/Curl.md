# Curl 
Since we can define a [[Vector Field]] $\vec{F}=N\hat{i}+M\hat{j}$, we can measure the rotational component of the vector field by a quantity called the "Curl":
$$\text{curl}(\vec{F})=N_{x}-M_{y}$$
If $\text{curl}(\vec{F})=0$ it follows that we have a [[Conservative Field]]. This follows since if $N_{x}=M_{y}$, then our vector field is conservative. 

If this test is passed and the vector field is defined everywhere, then our vector field is conservative. If our test fails, then our vector field is not conservative. If the test is passed but not defined everywhere, there is some ambiguity in our definition. 

For a velocity field, the curl measures the rotation part of motion. The curl measures twice the angular velocity of rotation component of a velocity field. 

The curl of a force field measures the torque exerted on an object in the field. 

The curl tells us how fast we are spinning at any given time up to a factor of two. The curl of the force field tells us how much fast our angular velocity will increase or decrease.
