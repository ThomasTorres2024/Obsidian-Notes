# Definition of Simply Connected
A connected region in the plane is simply connected if any closed curve if the interior of any closed curve in $R$ is also contained in $R$. Concretely, this means that our $R$ contains no holes in it.

If we know that a [[Vector Field]] is simply connected, we don't have to worry about any discontinuities when applying [[Green's Theorem]]. We can just apply it. 

Thus, if the domain where $\vec{F}$ is defined, simply connected, and differentiable, it follows that we can apply Green's Theorem. 

Secondly, if $\text{curl}(\vec{F})=0$ and the domain of $\vec{F}$ is simply connected, then $\vec{F}$ is a [[Conservative Field]], so $\vec{F}$ is a [[Gradient Field]].
