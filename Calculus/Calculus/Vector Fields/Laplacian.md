# Background
The Laplace Operator is given by $\nabla^2$, which operates on functions and is defined by the following using the [[Del]] Operator:
$$\nabla^2f = \nabla \cdot (\nabla f)=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}$$
The [[Laplacian]] is useful in mathematics. (I also think that it is the [[Trace]] of the [[Hessian Matrix]] of $f$).
