#  Linear Forms to Consider in $\mathbb{R}^n$
In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the most interesting linear subsets for us to consider are forms which we can describe through one [[vector]] alone, that is lines, $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $n$ dimensional hyperplanes which have a Co-Dimension of $1$ (I think this correlates to a null-space of 1 if we consider a representation of the hyper-plane as the linear combination of $n-1$ [[Linearly Independent Vectors]]).

We have an infinite amount of subspaces with dimension $\mathbb{R}^{n-1},\mathbb{R}^{n-2},\cdots,\mathbb{R}^{1}$ and so on.
