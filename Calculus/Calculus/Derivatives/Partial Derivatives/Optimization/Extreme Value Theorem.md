# Extreme Value Theorem 
The EVT allows us to guarantee that over a closed and bounded interval, a continuous function is guaranteed to have a maximum and minimum over the interval.  More formally, given a function $f : C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ where $C$ is a [[closed]] and [[bounded]] set over $C$ and $f$ is continuous along $C$, then $f$ is guaranteed to have a [[local minima]] and [[local maxima]].
