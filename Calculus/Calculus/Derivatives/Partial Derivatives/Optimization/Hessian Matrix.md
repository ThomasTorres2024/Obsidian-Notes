# Different Order Derivatives 

For each derivative of a multivariable function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we get a tensor which corresponds to the order of our derivative which encodes information about the rate of change of the function at that point. 

For instance, the first [[partial derivative]] of a function is the [[Gradient]] of a function:
$$\nabla f= \begin{bmatrix} f_{x} & f_{y} \end{bmatrix}^T$$
The second partial derivative is expressed by the symmetric matrix known as the [[Hessian Matrix]] which we denote as $\mathcal{H}$:
$$\nabla^2f= \begin{bmatrix} f_{xx} & f_{xy}\\f_{yx} & f_{yy} \end{bmatrix}=\mathcal{H}$$
The third partial derivative is expressed as a rank 3 [[tensor]]. 

The Hessian matrix and its associated trace and [[determinant]] are interesting quantities that we want to consider:

$$\text{det}(\mathcal{H})=f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2$$
$$\text{trace}(\mathcal{H})=f_{xx}+f_{yy}$$
The determinant of our hessian encodes the [[Second Derivative Test]]. 

The trace of our hessian matrix encodes the [[Laplacian]]. 

We can think of the Hessian matrix being the [[Gradient]] of the gradient of $f$. By this, we can think of differentiating the gradient by each variable, which generates two new vectors which we condense into a matrix:
$$\nabla f = \langle f_{x},f_{y}\rangle$$
After taking the gradient we want to take the derivative of our gradient with respect to $x$ and $y$, from which we obtain:

$$ \dfrac{\partial \nabla f}{\partial x}  = \langle f_{xx},f_{yx}\rangle$$
$$ \dfrac{\partial \nabla f}{\partial y}  = \langle f_{xy},f_{yy}\rangle$$
We can then take these two different vectors and stitch them together to create our Hessian. Likewise, the higher dimensional derivatives can be generated by differentiating our tensors again with respect to a new dimension and packaging the new derivative tensor into our nth derivative tensor.

# Cases for the First Derivative Test 
We only have three cases if we have no mixed partial derivatives. Our Hessian matrix turns out to be a diagonal matrix, which either has strictly positive entries, strictly negative entries, or positive and negative entries. 

Effectively, we are measuring if the matrices are positive definite, negative definite, or indefinite. Because we have restricted ourselves to the case in which the matrices are diagonal, their eigen values will be the entries along the diagonal. It follows that a diagonal matrix with strictly positive values along its diagonal is positive definite, and a matrix with strictly negative values is negative definite, all zeroes result in a matrix we know nothing about and our result requires analysis of higher degree-than-second derivatives, and any anything in-between is indefinite and we have a [[saddle point]].  

For example:
$$2x^2 + 3y^2 \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}4 & 0 \\ 0 & 6\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow \text{det}(\mathcal{H})>0 \rightarrow \text{Positive Definite, Local Maxima}$$
$$-x^2 -2y^2 \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}-2 & 0 \\ 0 & -4\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \text{det}(\mathcal{H}) >0  \rightarrow \text{Negative Definite, Local Minima}$$
$$x^2 -\frac{1}{2}y^2 \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \text{det}(\mathcal{H})<0 \rightarrow \text{Indefinite, saddle point}$$

The Laplacian tells us whether our result is a minima or a maxima. Since our Laplacian is simply $\text{tr}(\mathcal{H})$ it follows that for hessian matrices which satisfy $\text{det}(\mathcal{H})>0$ then:

1. $\text{tr}(\mathcal{H})>0 \rightarrow \text{Point is a local minima}$
2. $\text{tr}(\mathcal{H})>0 \rightarrow \text{Point is a local maxima}$

We can think of our eigen values as the maximum concavity achieved by some slice of a function along our surface. 

If we consider the more general case where our Hessian Matrix has entries outside of its diagonals, we can consider the case where we are 

The longest axes along which the parabola extends are known as the principal components of the parabola. These constitute
