# Contour
Given a [[Multivariable Functions]] $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, we define a contour by setting $f(z)=k$ for $k \in \mathbb{R}$ (a constant), and we obtain a function of the form $g : \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$, basically we take the function down a dimension, and we generate a family of functions which are related to the parent function. 

We can use this as a way to visualize a higher dimension function in lower dimensions. If we want an idea of how a curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ looks, we can generate [[Contour]]s in two dimensions, and continue to add them to get insight into the curve. 

We can do the same thing for $\mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}^3$, and generate a family of surfaces to under how $\mathbb{R}^4$ behaves and get some general idea.
