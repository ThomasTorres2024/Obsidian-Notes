# Definition
Cylindrical Coordinates are a combination of polar coordinates and cartesian. We describe an $x,y$ position by $\theta,r$ and the height of our function in $z$ remains as it is in cartesian. This is useful in [[Change of Variables]] for integration. 

Our equations are:
$$x=r\text{cos}(\theta)$$
$$y=r\text{sin}(\theta)$$
$$r^2=x^2+y^2$$
