A list of some integrals to memorize that I have trouble recalling. 

$$\int \text{tan}(x)^2dx=\text{tan}(x)-x+C$$
$$\int \text{sec}^3(x)dx = \dfrac{1}{2}(\text{sec}(x)\text{tan}(x)+\text{ln}|\text{sec}(x)+\text{tan}(x)|) + C$$
- Note this one is nasty to due, we can obtain it from IBP, it's a recursive case
