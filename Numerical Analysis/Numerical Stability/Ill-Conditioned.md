# Ill-Conditioned 
An [[Ill-Conditioned]] problem or algorithm in numerical analysis is a problem or algorithm where a small perturbation in the input results in a significant change in the output. We can gain insight into the [[Conditioning]] of a problem or algorithm by considering its [[Condition Number]].
