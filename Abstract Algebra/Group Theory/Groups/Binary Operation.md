# Binary Operation
For some set $G$, a binary operation on $G$ is a function that assigns each pair of elements from $G$ to another element in $G$, we denote this by: $G \times G \mapsto G$. 

For instance, consider the set of integers modulo $n$, then: 
$$\mathbb{Z}_n=\{0,1,\dots n-1\}$$
Addition under this set is defined by:
$$(a,b)\mapsto a+b\mod(n)$$
