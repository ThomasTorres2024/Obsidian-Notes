# [[Abelian Group]]
An [[Abelian Group]] is a group $G$ where, for $\forall a,b \in G$, we have that the [[Binary Operation]] follows:
$$a \circ b = b \circ a$$
Which is to say that our operation is commutative which means that $G$ is an [[Abelian Group]]. If $\exists a,b \in G$ such that $ab \neq ba \implies$ G is NOT an [[Abelian Group]].

# Examples of [[Abelian Group]]s 
The following groups are all [[Abelian Group]]s under addition:
$$\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$$
Which should make sense, since addition over these groups should be commutative.
