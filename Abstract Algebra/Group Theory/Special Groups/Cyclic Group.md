A [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] is a [[Group]] that can be generated by considering some $a \in G$. Then, we denote:
$$\langle a \rangle : = \{ a^n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$$
Then this set is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. We call $\langle a \rangle$ the [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] which is generated by $a$. It can be proved that $\langle a \rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. 

#### Proof $\langle a \rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]]of $G$. 
It is known that $\langle a \rangle \neq \varnothing$. Consider the elements, $a^n, a^m \in \langle a \rangle$ where $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, the operation:
$$a^n(a^m)^{-1} = a^{n-m} \in \langle a \rangle  \text{ by def of } \langle a \rangle$$
Therefore, by the [[Subgroup]] test of 1 element, it follows that $G$ is a subgroup. 

We can generalize the idea of a group formed from $a$, just a single element of $G$, to a subset of elements, $S$ such that $\langle S \rangle$ is the smallest [[Subgroup]] which contains all members of $S$, even if this means that $\langle S \rangle = G$. We can also define this as the intersection of all [[Subgroup]]s of $G$ which contain $S$, which thus forms a new subgroup automatically.

##### (Thm 4.1) Criterion for $a^i=a^j$ 
Let $G$ be a [[Group]], let $a \in G$. $O(a)=\infty \iff$ $a^i=a^j \text{ only when } i=j$. If $O(a) \neq \infty$, then $a^i=a^j$ when $n$ divides $i-j$. 

##### Proof:
If $O(a)=\infty \implies \not \exists n, a^n = e$ (follows from def of [[Order]]). 
$$a^{i}=a^{j}$$
Then using cancellation:
$$a^{i-j}=e$$
Which thus entails that $i-j=0 \implies i=j$. The other portion of the proof is trivial. 

Now we will prove the portion when $a$ has finite order $O(a)=n$ that $a^i=a^j$ iff $n | i-j$. 

First we need to show that the generator for $a$ yields the following:
$$\langle a \rangle = \{e,a,a^2,\dots a^{n-1} \}$$
Since $O(a)=n \implies$ the elements in $\langle a \rangle$ are unique. For some $a^k \in \langle  a\rangle$, we can use the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] to express $\exists q,r \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $k=nq+r$ where $0 \leq r < n$ that allows us to express $a^k$ as:
$$a^k=a^{nq+r}=a^{nq}\cdot a^r=e\cdot a^r=a^r$$
So, any member of $\langle a \rangle$ is of the form:
$$\langle a \rangle = \{e,a,a^2,\dots a^{n-1} \}$$
It can now be shown that $a | i-j$. Recall that:
$$a^i=a^j \iff a^{i-j}=n$$
Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] again we have that, $i-j=nq+r$ for $0 \leq r < n$:

# Examples 
#### Example 1.) $U(10)$. 
Notice that $U(10)$ consists of all positive integers relatively prime to $10$, thus:
$$U=\langle 1,3,7,9 \rangle$$
Notice also that we can generate $U(10)$ via a [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] using $\langle 3 \rangle$ and multi $\mod(10)$:
$$3^1=3,3^2=9,3^3=7, 3^4=1$$
$$3^{-1}=7,3^{-2}=1,3^{-3}=3.3^{-4}=1$$
#### Example 2.) $\mathbb{Z}_{10} = \langle 2 \rangle$. 
The [[Group]] formed by $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0,2,4,6,8 \}$. We can similarly generate it by $\langle 2 \rangle$:
$$2^1=2,2^2=4,2^3=6,2^4=8,2^5=0$$
$$2^{-1}=2^4,2^{-2}=2^3,2^{-3}=2^2,2^{-4}=2^1,2^5=0$$
#### Example 3.) $\mathbb{Z} = \langle -1 \rangle$ under normal addition 
Clearly we just generate every integer from repeated addition. 

#### Example 4.) $\mathbb{Z}_{20} = \langle 8,14 \rangle$ under normal $\mod(20)$ 
$$=\{0,2,\dots,18 \}$$
#### Example 5.) $\mathbb{Z} = \langle 8,13 \rangle$ under normal addition
We have that $8\cdot5=40$ and $13 \cdot 3 =39$, so we can express $40-39=1$ and obtain every number using this number.  

#### Example 6.) $\mathbb{R} = \langle 2,\pi, \sqrt{2} \rangle$ under normal addition forms the group:
$$\{2a+b\pi+c\sqrt{2} : a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
#### Example 7.) $\mathbb{C} = \langle 1,i \rangle$ under normal addition forms the group:

$$\{ai+b : a,b\in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
#### Example 8.) $\mathbb{C}^* = \langle 1,i \rangle$ with multiplication
$$\langle 1,i\rangle = \{1,-1,i,-i \}$$
