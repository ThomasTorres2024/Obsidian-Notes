A [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] is a [[Group]] that can be generated by considering some $a \in G$. Then, we denote:
$$\langle a \rangle : = \{ a^n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$$
Then this set is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. We call $\langle a \rangle$ the [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] which is generated by $a$. It can be proved that $\langle a \rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. 

#### Proof $\langle a \rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]]of $G$. 
It is known that $\langle a \rangle \neq \varnothing$. Consider the elements, $a^n, a^m \in \langle a \rangle$ where $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, the operation:
$$a^n(a^m)^{-1} = a^{n-m} \in \langle a \rangle  \text{ by def of } \langle a \rangle$$
Therefore, by the [[Subgroup]] test of 1 element, it follows that $G$ is a subgroup. 

We can generalize the idea of a group formed from $a$, just a single element of $G$, to a subset of elements, $S$ such that $\langle S \rangle$ is the smallest [[Subgroup]] which contains all members of $S$, even if this means that $\langle S \rangle = G$. We can also define this as the intersection of all [[Subgroup]]s of $G$ which contain $S$, which thus forms a new subgroup automatically.

# Examples 
#### Example 1.) $U(10)$. 
Notice that $U(10)$ consists of all positive integers relatively prime to $10$, thus:
$$U=\langle 1,3,7,9 \rangle$$
Notice also that we can generate $U(10)$ via a [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] using $\langle 3 \rangle$ and multi $\mod(10)$:
$$3^1=3,3^2=9,3^3=7, 3^4=1$$
$$3^{-1}=7,3^{-2}=1,3^{-3}=3.3^{-4}=1$$
#### Example 2.) $\mathbb{Z}_{10} = \langle 2 \rangle$. 
The [[Group]] formed by $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0,2,4,6,8 \}$. We can similarly generate it by $\langle 2 \rangle$:
$$2^1=2,2^2=4,2^3=6,2^4=8,2^5=0$$
$$2^{-1}=2^4,2^{-2}=2^3,2^{-3}=2^2,2^{-4}=2^1,2^5=0$$
#### Example 3.) $\mathbb{Z} = \langle -1 \rangle$ under normal addition 
Clearly we just generate every integer from repeated addition. 

#### Example 4.) $\mathbb{Z}_{20} = \langle 8,14 \rangle$ under normal $\mod(20)$ 
$$=\{0,2,\dots,18 \}$$
#### Example 5.) $\mathbb{Z} = \langle 8,13 \rangle$ under normal addition
We have that $8\cdot5=40$ and $13 \cdot 3 =39$, so we can express $40-39=1$ and obtain every number using this number.  

#### Example 6.) $\mathbb{R} = \langle 2,\pi, \sqrt{2} \rangle$ under normal addition forms the group:
$$\{2a+b\pi+c\sqrt{2} : a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
#### Example 7.) $\mathbb{C} = \langle 1,i \rangle$ under normal addition forms the group:

$$\{ai+b : a,b\in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
#### Example 8.) $\mathbb{C}^* = \langle 1,i \rangle$ with multiplication
$$\langle 1,i\rangle = \{1,-1,i,-i \}$$
