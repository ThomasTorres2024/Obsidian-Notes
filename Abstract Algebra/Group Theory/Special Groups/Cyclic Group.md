A [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] is a [[Group]] that can be generated by considering some $a \in G$. Then, we denote:
$$\langle a \rangle : = \{ a^n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$$
Then this set is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. We call $\langle a \rangle$ the [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] which is generated by $a$. It can be proved that $\langle a \rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. 

#### Proof $\langle a \rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]]of $G$. 
It is known that $\langle a \rangle \neq \varnothing$. Consider the elements, $a^n, a^m \in \langle a \rangle$ where $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, the operation:
$$a^n(a^m)^{-1} = a^{n-m} \in \langle a \rangle  \text{ by def of } \langle a \rangle$$
Therefore, by the [[Subgroup]] test of 1 element, it follows that $G$ is a subgroup. 

We can generalize the idea of a group formed from $a$, just a single element of $G$, to a subset of elements, $S$ such that $\langle S \rangle$ is the smallest [[Subgroup]] which contains all members of $S$, even if this means that $\langle S \rangle = G$. We can also define this as the intersection of all [[Subgroup]]s of $G$ which contain $S$, which thus forms a new subgroup automatically.

##### (Thm 4.1) Criterion for $a^i=a^j$ 
Let $G$ be a [[Group]], let $a \in G$. $O(a)=\infty \iff$ $a^i=a^j \text{ only when } i=j$. If $O(a) \neq \infty$, then $a^i=a^j$ when $n$ divides $i-j$. 

##### Proof:
If $O(a)=\infty \implies \not \exists n, a^n = e$ (follows from def of [[Order]]). 
$$a^{i}=a^{j}$$
Then using cancellation:
$$a^{i-j}=e$$
Which thus entails that $i-j=0 \implies i=j$. The other portion of the proof is trivial. 

Now we will prove the portion when $a$ has finite order $O(a)=n$ that $a^i=a^j$ iff $n | i-j$. 

First we need to show that the generator for $a$ yields the following:
$$\langle a \rangle = \{e,a,a^2,\dots a^{n-1} \}$$
Since $O(a)=n \implies$ the elements in $\langle a \rangle$ are unique. For some $a^k \in \langle  a\rangle$, we can use the [[Division Algorithm]] to express $\exists q,r \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $k=nq+r$ where $0 \leq r < n$ that allows us to express $a^k$ as:
$$a^k=a^{nq+r}=a^{nq}\cdot a^r=e\cdot a^r=a^r$$
So, any member of $\langle a \rangle$ is of the form:
$$\langle a \rangle = \{e,a,a^2,\dots a^{n-1} \}$$
It can now be shown that $a | i-j$. Recall that:
$$a^i=a^j \iff a^{i-j}=e$$
Using the [[Division Algorithm]] again we have that, $i-j=nq+r$ for $0 \leq r < n$, then:
$$a^{i-j}=a^{nq+r}=e$$
$$=(a^q)^n\cdot a^r=e \cdot a^r = a^r=e$$
We have that $r=0$, so $\implies i-j=nq$. The other direction for this proof is trivial, if $i-j | n$ then we can easily verify this condition of $a^i=a^j$:
$$a^{i-j}=a^{nq}=e$$
$$\iff a^i = a^j$$
## Important Corollaries from this Result:
#### Corollary 1.) Agreement of Order 
For $a \in G$, $|a| = | \langle a \rangle |$. 

#### Corollary 2.) $a^k=e$ iff $O(a) | k$  
$$a^k=e \iff a^k = a^0 \iff a^{k-0} \iff O(a) | k$$

#### Corollary 3.) If $a^k=e$ for $a \in G$, $a^k=e$ iff $k$ is a multiple of $|a|$ 
#### Corollary 4.) Relationship between $|ab|$ and $|a| |b|$. 
Generally nothing is given, but if we have that $a,b \in G$ where $G$ is a [[Finite Group]] and $ab=ba$ then it follows that $|ab|$ divides $|a| |b|$: 

##### Proof: 
If we let $|a|=m$ and $|b|=n$ then we can write:
$$(ab)^{mn} = (a^m)^n(b^n)^m=e^ne^m=e$$
We therefore have by corollary 2 that:
$$|ab| | mn$$
# Modular Arithmetic and the [[Binary Operation]] of a [[Cyclic Group]] 

If we have that $(i+j) \mod(n)=k$ then we know that:
$$a^{i}\cdot a^j = a^k \iff i+j \mod(n)=k$$
Essentially every [[Cyclic Group]] has this underlying structure, meaning that there really only is 1 cyclic group. This behavior here is a Group [[Isomorphism]]. 

##### Theorem 4.2) Determining the order of $|a^k|$ given only $|a|$ 
For group $G$ and $a \in G$ where $|a|=n$, then $\langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n.k)} \rangle$ and $|a^k|=n/\gcd(n,k)\rangle$. 

#### Proof
Let $d=\gcd(n,k)$ and $k=dr$, we have that:
$$a^k=(a^d)^r$$And then by closure we obtain:
$$\langle a^k \rangle \subseteq \langle a^d \rangle $$
Then by the [[Division Algorithm]] we have that $\exists s,t \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $d=ns+kt$, so we obtain that:
$$a^d=a^{ns+kt}=a^{ns}a^{kt}=(a^n)^s(a^k)^t=e\cdot (a^k)^t \implies a^d \in \langle  a^k \rangle$$
Thus by equality of sets $\langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^d \rangle$, and we obtain the first result that:
$$\langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n.k)} \rangle$$
Now for the second part of the theorem. Let $|a^d|=n/d$ where $d$ is a divisor of $n$. Then:
$$(a^d)^{n/d}=a^n=e $$
So we obtain that $|a^d| \leq n/d$. But if $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then 
$$(a^d)^i\neq e$$
Which is because $di < n$. Thereby $|a^d| = n/d$ exactly. If we allow $d=\gcd(n,k)$ then, we can apply the result we just derived, and we obtain that:

$$|a^k|=|\langle a^k \rangle|=|\langle a^{\gcd(n,k)} \rangle| = |a^{\gcd(n,k)}|=\frac{n}{\gcd(n,k)}$$
#### Corollaries of this Result
###### Order of Elements in Finite Cyclic Groups
In a [[Finite Group]] that is cyclic, the order of an element divides the order of the group. Let $G$ be a group, and let $|G|=n$. Then, for $G=\langle a \rangle$, we let $d=\gcd(n,k)$. 

Then by the previous theorem we have that:
$$|a^k|= \frac{n}{\gcd(n,k)}=\frac{n}{d} \iff d|a^k| =n  \implies |a^k| \bigg| n$$
Clearly, we obtain the result that the order of an element in the group $|a^k|$, divides the order of the group $|G|=n$.

###### Corollary 2.) Criterion for $\langle a^i \rangle = \langle a^j \rangle$ and $|a^i|=|a^j|$ 
If $G$ is a cyclic group then the following statements are equivalent:
* 1.) $\langle a^i \rangle  = \langle a^j \rangle$ 
* 2.) $O(a^i)=O(a^j)$
* 3.) $\gcd(n,i)=\gcd(n,j)$

$1.) \implies 2$
Using the fact that $O(a^i)=O(\langle a^i \rangle)$, then: 
$$O(a^i)=O(\langle a^i \rangle)=O(\langle a^j \rangle ) = O(a^j) \iff O(a^i) = O(a^j)$$
Also immediate from other first corollary, 2 groups must have equal order here if they are finite (I think this also works or is the symbolic version of it). 

$2.) \implies 3$
We are given that $O(a^i)=O(a^j)$, then:
$$O(a^i)= \frac{n}{ \gcd(n,i)} = O(a^j) = \frac{n}{\gcd(n,j)} \iff \gcd(n,i) = \gcd(n,j) $$

$3.) \implies 1$
We are given that $\gcd(n,i) = \gcd(n,j)$. 
By previous theorem:
$$\langle a^i \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n,i)} \rangle , \langle a^j \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n,j)} \rangle  $$
But since $\langle a^{\gcd(n,i)} \rangle  = \langle a^{\gcd(n,j)} \rangle$ we have that:
$$\langle a^i \rangle = \langle a^j \rangle $$
Thus the circuit is complete.

### Corollary 3 - Generators of Finite Cyclic Groups
We can determine what the generators are of Finite Cyclic groups using the following. Given a group $G$ that is finite and cyclic of order $n$ s.t. $|a|=n$, then TFAE:
* 1.) $\langle a^i \rangle = \langle a \rangle = G$  
* 2.) $O(a^i)=O(a)=n$
* 3.) $\gcd(n,i)=1$

These are all essentially true by supposing that $j=1$. Then for any $i$ where the above criterion are satisfies implies all of the results of this corollary. Nothing is particularly new here.

$1 \implies 2 \implies 3 \implies 1$  
True via Corollary 2 that was shown above, this is just for $j=1$. 

I think this helps elucidate the concept a bit more. If we have that $a^i$, and we know its a generator then:
$$O(a^i) = \frac{n}{\gcd(n,i)} = \frac{n}{1}=n$$
I think this makes it a bit clearer. Intuitively, we know that every $a^k$ must be unique for $k \mod(n)$, and since we have that this group has $n$ elements, we are eventually going to need to cover every single element the group crossed by.  

### Corollary 4 - Generators of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ 
For $k \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, $k$ is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ iff $\gcd(n,k)=1$. 

$\implies$
If $k$ is a Generator of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ then $\gcd(n,k)=1$ is true by corollary 3. We have that $\langle a^k \rangle = \langle a \rangle$, and since the corollary is true, it follows that $\gcd(n,k)=1$. 

$\Longleftarrow$ 
If $\gcd(n,k)=1$, then since the corollary is true it follows that $\langle a \rangle = \langle a^k \rangle$.  

Corollary 4 and 3 can be used to identify the generators of cyclic groups.

# Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups 
We are interested in ascertaining how many [[Subgroup]]s a finite cyclic group has. We will demonstrate the following result. 

Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. 

If a cyclic group $G$ has order $n$ defined by $G = \langle a \rangle$ then, any subgroup of $G$ has an order which is a divisor of $n$, and for each positive divisor $k$ of $n$, $\langle a \rangle$ has one subgroup of order $k$, which is $\langle a ^{\frac{n}{k}} \rangle$.  

More concretely if $G$ is a finite group of order $n=30$, then all of the Subgroups of this group are of the form $\langle a^{\frac{30}{k}} \rangle$, which would entail that the divisors, $k$ would be:
$$k \in \{1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30 \}$$
Then we would have that the subgroups of $G$ are:
$$\langle a^{30}\rangle, \langle a^{15}\rangle, \langle a^{10}\rangle, \langle a^6\rangle, \langle a^5\rangle, \langle a^3\rangle, \langle a^2\rangle, \langle a^1\rangle$$

#### Proof.)
Let $G = \langle a \rangle$ and let $H \leq G$. We need to show that $H$ is a cyclic group. 

If $H = \{e \}$, then $H$ must be a cyclic group. 

###### Claim.)
We claim that $a^t \in H$ fir  $a^t, t \in \mathbb{N}$. Since it is known that $G=\langle a \rangle$, every element of $G$ is of the form $a^t$ for $t \in \mathbb{Z}$. 

But since we have ruled out that $H \neq \{e \}$ as in the above case, and it is a subgroup, it must be the case that it includes some $a^t$ where $t \in \mathbb{Z} \textbackslash \{0 \}$. 

$t>0$ is our desired result, but if $t <0$, then $-t>0$  and $a^{-t} \in H$. Due to properties of being a group, its inverse must also be in the group. So, either way, we know that there is an $a^t$ in $H$ that can be represented by a positive integer. $\diamondsuit$ 

Let $m$ be the least positive integer for $a^m \in H$, we know that $H$ contains some $a^t$ now and so we are allowed to do this. By closure, of groups, we can say that:
$$\langle a^m \rangle \subseteq H$$
We want to show that $\langle a^m \rangle = H$ which means we must show that $\langle a^m \rangle \supseteq H$. 
If we can show that an arbitrary member $b \in H$ has the property that $b \in \langle a^m \rangle$, then we have our desired result. 

Since $b \in G \implies b =a^k$ for some integer $k$. Using the [[Division Algorithm]], we know that $\exists q,r \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $k=mq+r$ for $0 \leq r < m$. 

Then:
$$a^k = a^{mq+r}=a^{mq} \circ a^r \iff a^r = a^{-mq}a^k$$
Recall that $\langle a^m \rangle \subseteq H$. Clearly, $a^{-mq} \in H$, and so $a^r=a^{-mq}a^k=a^{-mq}b \in H$ due to closure.  

We chose $m$ to be the least positive integer for which $a^m \in H$ and we imposed by the [[Division Algorithm]] that $0 \leq r < m$. To spell it out $a^r$ is clearly in $H$, but it can't be $a^m$ due to the conditions of the division algorithm we imposed, and furthermore it is less than $m$,  so it must follow that the only valid $r$ here is for $r=0$. And since $r=0 \implies a^r=e$.   

Therefore, we obtain that $r=0$ due to the minimality of $m$, and $0 \leq r < m$. We obtain that:
$$a^r = a^{-mq}a^k \iff a^{mq}=a^k $$
Then:
$$b=a^{mq} = (a^m)^q \in \langle a^m \rangle $$
And since $b \in H$, it follows that $\langle a^m \rangle = H$, and therefore by the definition of cyclic group, $H$ is a cyclic group.

---
We want to now show that every subgroup of cyclic group $G$ is of the form $\langle a ^{\frac{n}{k}} \rangle$ where $k$ is a divisor of $n$, and that each is uniquely defined. 

Recall that:
$$\langle a^m \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(m,n)} \rangle $$

Let us consider the following:
(I am shaky on this part, not sure how we justify this)
Because $m$ is chosen to be as small as possible, we can assume that $m$ is a divisor of $n$, such that:
$$|\langle a^m \rangle|=\frac{n}{m}$$
Furthermore, if $k$ is a positive divisor of $n$ then:
$$|\langle a^{\frac{n}{k}} \rangle | = \frac{n}{n/k}=k$$
If $K \leq \langle a \rangle$ where $O(K)=k$, then via the previous result we obtain that:
$$K=\langle a^s \rangle \text{ s.t. } s|n$$
And $s$ satisfies that $s|n, |\langle a^s \rangle | = \frac{n}{s} = k$. Thus, $s=\frac{n}{k}$. So, there is only one subgroup of order $k$. 

This finishes the proof, and we have shown every subgroup of cyclic $G$ is another cyclic group. Furthermore, every subgroup of $G$ is of the form $\langle a^{\frac{n}{k}} \rangle$ where $k | n$, and there is one subgroup for each corresponding order. $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$

# [[Euler's Totient Function]] 
The number of elements in a subgroup of a particular order can be calculated by the Euler Phi function. Consider the following:

$$\phi(n) = \begin{cases}1  \text{ for } n=1 \\ \\ \text{number of natural numbers k} \newline 1 \leq k < n, \text{ with } \gcd(k,n)=1 \newline \text{for } n > 1 \end{cases}$$
Furthermore, note that we have a relation between groups of the form $U(n)$, we can describe their [[Order]] with $|U(n)|=\phi(n)$. 

| $n$       | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\phi(n)$ | 1   | 1   | 2   | 2   | 4   | 2   | 6   | 4   | 6   |
## Theorem 
If $d$ is a positive divisor of $n$ where $n$ is the order of a finite cyclic group, the number of elements of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is $\phi(d)$. 

###### Pf.) 
This follows nicely from the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups. For $G$, we know that $\exists$ only one subgroup of order $d$. Let us denote it by $\langle a \rangle$. 

Every element of order $d$ generates this subgroup. We also know that $\langle a^k \rangle=1$ iff $\gcd(k,d)=1$. But that implies the total number of elements which are relatively prime that are naturals and less than $d$, which is of course equivalent to $\phi(d)$.  
$$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$
As an interesting remark here, the total number of subgroups  for a finite cyclic group of order $n$, is entirely defined by $\phi(d)$, and is independent of $n$. 

# Number of Elements of Order $d$ in a General Finite Group 
Instead of just looking at [[Finite Group]]s that are Cyclic, let us consider general [[Cyclic Group]]s. It turns out the number of subgroups of order $d$ in a general Cyclic Group is a multiple of $\phi(d)$. 

### Proof.)
Let $G$ be a finite group. If $G$ has no elements of order, then it is 0 here, and  $\phi(d) | 0$. 

Otherwise, suppose $G$ has an element of order $d$. Then $\langle a \rangle$ contains $\phi(d)$ elements of order $d$ (this result was proved when introducing the Euler Phi Function). 

This covers the finite case of $G$. 

Suppose $G$ has another element $b$ where $O(b)=d$. Then, $\langle a \rangle$ contains another $\phi(d)$ elements of order $d$. 

##### Claim.) 
None of the elements in $\langle b \rangle$ belong to $\langle a \rangle$ where both sets are of order $d$. Suppose $b^k \in \langle b \rangle$ has order $d$, so $\gcd(k,d)=1$. 

If $b^k$ is an element of order $d$ of $\langle a \rangle$ then, $b^k=a^k$ for some $k$ with $\gcd(k,d)=1$. Since $\gcd(k,d)=1$, then $\exists s,t  \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that:
$$sk+td=1$$
We also obtain that $\gcd(s,d)=1$ through this result. Now we can express:
$$b^1=b^{sk+td}=(b^k)^s \circ (b^d)^t = (a^k)^s \circ e ^ t = a^{sk}$$
But since $\gcd(s,d)=1$ and $\gcd(k,d)=1$, then $\gcd(sk,d)=1$. But this implies that $b \in \langle a \rangle$, which was assumed not to be the case, which by contradiction gives us the result of the claim..

Therefore, none of the elements of $\langle b \rangle$ belong to $\langle a \rangle$. 
$$\tag*{$\diamond$}$$
Now that the claim has been proved, for $b \not \in \langle a \rangle$ where $|b|=d$, then we obtain an additional cyclic group with $\phi(d)$ many elements such that the two sets generated by $b$ and $a$ are disjoint. Therefore, we have some multiple of $\phi(d)$ many groups in this case. 

Similarly, if $G$ has another $c$ where $c$ is disjoint from the sets generated by $a$ and $b$, then the argument continues much the same way. Since $G$ is assumed finite we run out of elements, therefore we end up with some finite multiple. 










# Examples 
#### Example 1.) $U(10)$. 
Notice that $U(10)$ consists of all positive integers relatively prime to $10$, thus:
$$U=\langle 1,3,7,9 \rangle$$
Notice also that we can generate $U(10)$ via a [[Abstract Algebra/Group Theory/Special Groups/Cyclic Group|Cyclic Group]] using $\langle 3 \rangle$ and multi $\mod(10)$:
$$3^1=3,3^2=9,3^3=7, 3^4=1$$
$$3^{-1}=7,3^{-2}=1,3^{-3}=3.3^{-4}=1$$
#### Example 2.) $\mathbb{Z}_{10} = \langle 2 \rangle$. 
The [[Group]] formed by $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0,2,4,6,8 \}$. We can similarly generate it by $\langle 2 \rangle$:
$$2^1=2,2^2=4,2^3=6,2^4=8,2^5=0$$
$$2^{-1}=2^4,2^{-2}=2^3,2^{-3}=2^2,2^{-4}=2^1,2^5=0$$
#### Example 3.) $\mathbb{Z} = \langle -1 \rangle$ under normal addition 
Clearly we just generate every integer from repeated addition. 

#### Example 4.) $\mathbb{Z}_{20} = \langle 8,14 \rangle$ under normal $\mod(20)$ 
$$=\{0,2,\dots,18 \}$$
#### Example 5.) $\mathbb{Z} = \langle 8,13 \rangle$ under normal addition
We have that $8\cdot5=40$ and $13 \cdot 3 =39$, so we can express $40-39=1$ and obtain every number using this number.  

#### Example 6.) $\mathbb{R} = \langle 2,\pi, \sqrt{2} \rangle$ under normal addition forms the group:
$$\{2a+b\pi+c\sqrt{2} : a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
#### Example 7.) $\mathbb{C} = \langle 1,i \rangle$ under normal addition forms the group:

$$\{ai+b : a,b\in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
#### Example 8.) $\mathbb{C}^* = \langle 1,i \rangle$ with multiplication
$$\langle 1,i\rangle = \{1,-1,i,-i \}$$

# Examples For Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups 

#### EX 1.) Consider $\mathbb{Z}_{36}$. 
Via the fundamental theorem of cyclic groups, there is one unique subgroup of order $9$, given by $\langle 36/9 \rangle = \langle 4 \rangle$. We can find all the generators of this group by looking for other groups that are of order $9$:
$$\gcd(36,4j)=4 \iff \gcd(9,j)=1$$
Then we can obtain the following equivalent generators for $\mathbb{Z}_{36}$:
$$\langle 4 \cdot 1 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 2 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 4 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 5 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 7 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 8 \rangle$$
Notice that we cannot use $\langle 4 \cdot 3 \rangle$ and $\langle 4  \cdot 6\rangle$ because the GCD involving $3$ and $9$ and $6$ and $9$ is not 1. Then, our generators are of the form:
$$\langle (a^4)^1 \rangle = \langle (a^4)^2 \rangle = \langle (a^4)^4 \rangle = \langle (a^4)^5 \rangle = \langle (a^4)^7 \rangle = \langle (a^4)^8 \rangle$$
Note that once we have some generator given by $\langle a^{\frac{n}{d}} \rangle$ for our group, that other generators can be found by computing $\langle (a^{\frac{n}{d}})^j \rangle$  for $j \in U(d)$, which is to say the numbers relatively prime to $d$ in the range of $1$ to $d-1$.
