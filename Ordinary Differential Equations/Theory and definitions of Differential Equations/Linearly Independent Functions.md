For two functions to be [[linearly independent]] means that they cannot be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other constant. For instance, $e^x$ and $5e^x$ are linearly dependent, since $5e^x = 5\cdot e^x$.  

Two functions f and g are linearly independent if for any $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ the equation $k_{1}f(x) + k_{2}g(x) \neq 0$. Function can be said to be linearly  dependent if $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ cause the two functions to be equal to zero in this equation.  We can use the [[Wronskian]] to determine if some functions are [[Linearly Independent Functions]] or not.
