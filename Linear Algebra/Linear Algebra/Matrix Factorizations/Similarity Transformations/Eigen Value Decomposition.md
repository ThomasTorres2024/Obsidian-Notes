# Eigen Value Decomposition
For some matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ if for each [[Eigen Value]] $\lambda$ of $A$, we have that the [[algebraic multiplicities]] $\leq$ [[Geometric Multiplicity]] of each [[Eigen Value]], then $\exists P$, the matrix of [[Eigen Vector]]s for each [[Eigen Value]], and $\exists D$ which is the [[diagonal matrix]] such that every entry is an [[Eigen Value]] along the diagonal. 

It follows that:
$$A=$$
