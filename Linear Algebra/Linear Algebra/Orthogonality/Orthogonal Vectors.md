# Definition
Two vectors, $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are orthogonal if and only if they have an inner product of zero. We have a geometric interpretation of such vectors, namely that they are perpendicular to each other. 

Vectors are said to be [[orthonormal]] if each $\vec{x},\vec{y}$ involved has a magnitude of 1.
