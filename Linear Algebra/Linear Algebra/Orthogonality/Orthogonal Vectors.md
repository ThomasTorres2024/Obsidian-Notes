# Definition
Two vectors, $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are orthogonal if and only if they have an inner product of zero. We have a geometric interpretation of such vectors, namely that they are perpendicular to each other. 

Vectors are said to be [[orthonormal]] if each $\vec{x},\vec{y}$ involved has a magnitude of 1.

# Orthogonal Vectors and the Pythagorean Theorem 
We can write the conditions of the pythagorean theorem out using a set of $n$ orthogonal vectors, $\{ x_{i} \}$. We know that the sum of the other sides squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared, this is to say:
$$ \left\| \sum_{i=1}^n \vec{x}_{i} \right\|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \| \vec{x}_{i} \|^2$$
The hypotenuse is obtained by summing the orthogonal vectors together.
