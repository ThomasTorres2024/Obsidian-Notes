The [[Characteristic Polynomial]] of a matrix, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the polynomial defined by:
$$\det(A-\lambda I)=p_A(\lambda)$$
The solutions to the [[Characteristic Polynomial]] when we let $p_A(\lambda)$ are known as the [[Eigen Value]]s of $A$. 

The [[Characteristic Polynomial]] is a monic polynomial of the $n$th degree that can be expressed in the following:
$$p_A(\lambda)=(\lambda -\lambda_1)\cdot (\lambda -\lambda_2)\dots (\lambda - \lambda _n) $$

Two matrices are said to be [[Similar Matrices]] iff they have the same [[Characteristic Polynomial]].
