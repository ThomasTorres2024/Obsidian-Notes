# Cramer's Rule for Solving [[Second Order Differential Equation]]s
We can use Cramer's rule to solve for the two coefficients of [[system of equations]]. This is done by substituting the values of the solution of a $2 \times 2$ system into the $x$ and $y$ depending upon what we are trying to solve. 

Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the [[Wronskian]] of the [[system of equations]]:

$$x = \frac{	\begin{bmatrix}
C & B\\
D & F
\end{bmatrix} }{\det(\mathcal{W})}$$

$$y = \frac{	\begin{bmatrix}
A & C\\
E & D
\end{bmatrix}}{\det(\mathcal{W})}$$
