# [[Linearly Dependent]] (Definition)
A set of vectors, $S=\{v_1,v_2,\dots, v_n \}$ is [[Linearly Dependent]] if for some $1 \leq i \leq n$, at least one $v_i$ can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in $S$ not including itself, or equivalent with math we can say that:
$$v_i=\sum_{j \neq i}^n v_jc_j:c_j\in \mathbb{F}$$
