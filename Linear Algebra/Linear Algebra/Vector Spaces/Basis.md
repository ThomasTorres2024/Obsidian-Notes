# Basis 
The [[Basis]] of a [[Vector Space]] is a set of vectors, $S=\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n \}$ such that each vector in $S$ is [[Linearly Independent]], and furthermore that the set of all [[linear combination]]s of vectors in $S$, is equivalent to the [[Vector Space]]. That is to say:
$$\text{span}(S)=\sum_{i=1}^nv_ic_i:c_i \in \mathbb{F}=V$$
