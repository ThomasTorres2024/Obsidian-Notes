# Definition
The [[Hermitian]] of a matrix is also known as the Conjugate Transpose of a matrix. For a matrix, $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times m}$, the [[Hermitian]] operator "flips" the matrix, by performing a transpose, and then finding the complex conjugate of each element in our matrix, where the complex conjugate of an entry is denoted by a bar:

A matrix which is [[Hermitian]] is like a [[Symmetric Matrix]], which is to say that:
$$A^H=A$$
If a real matrix is [[Hermitian]] it is also [[Symmetric Matrix]]. Much like for the case of a [[Symmetric Matrix]], we have that:
$$(AB)^H=B^HA^H$$
