# Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm Overview
A [[Divide and Conquer Algorithm]] for [[Matrix Multiplication]] which has been iterated on significantly. The newest iteration is around $O(n^{2.371339})$, ultimately very inefficient. By the nature of [[Time Complexity]], we ignore the massive constant $C$ cost, which is in the billions. So this algorithm is not at all practical.
