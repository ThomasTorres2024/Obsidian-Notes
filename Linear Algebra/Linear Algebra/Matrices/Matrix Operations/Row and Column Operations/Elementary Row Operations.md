# Elementary Row Operations 
[[Elementary Row Operations]] are operations that we can perform on the rows of a matrix. We have three fundamental operations:

* 1.) Swapping Rows 
* 2.) Adding One Row to Another 
* 3.) Scaling One Row by Some Value 

We can describe each of these [[Elementary Row Operations]] by left multiplication of some sequence of [[Elementary Matrix]], each of which are equivalent to applying one of the above three fundamental operations.
