# Symmetric Matrix
A [[Symmetric Matrix]] is a matrix, $A \in \mathbb{F}^{n \times n}$ that satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
* $A^T=A$
* $A_{ij}=A_{ji}$ 

A [[Symmetric Matrix]] is also a [[Normal Matrices]], which means $A^TA=AA^T$, so $A$ is [[unitarily diagonalizable]]. We also should look at [[Spectral Theorem Definition and Proof]] and [[Normal Matrices and Spectral Theorem Proof]].
