# Overview of [[Random Matrices]]
[[Random Matrices]] are matrices, $M$ where each $M_{ij}$ comes from some probability distribution. We often assume in Random Matrix theory that each index is "iid" (Independent and Identically Distributed). We cannot assume that [[Random Matrices]] are symmetric, so eigen value analysis becomes more difficult. 

We have different methods for distributing entries in a matrix. Some of the most common and famous choices are [[Bernouli Random Matrices]] and [[Gaussian Random Matrices]] both of which make use of the [[Bernouli Distribution]] and [[Gaussian Distribution]] respectively. Using these distributions results in nice explicit formulas, whereas other distributions tend to have more difficult expressions to work with. 

For instance, we can express the difference between the two eigen values of a $2 \times 2$ [[Gaussian Random Matrices]] using the [[Wigner Surmise]], which can be explicitly derived through a bit of computation.
