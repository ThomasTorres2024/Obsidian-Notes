Prediction function 
$$f(\vec{x})=\hat{y}$$
We have the error fnction as well

$$Error(\hat{y},y)$$
If we feed a new image into our image prediction algorithm $x$, we get our prediction $\hat{y}$.

# How do we represent datasets of examples and labels?

$D$ is the Dataset of examples given by $D= \{(x,y) \}_{i=1}^n$, where we index our data entries.  

Our paper was concerned with dimension reduction in datasets, and how to improve on previous models that were good at handling dimension reduction locally and globally but nothing that could do both reasonably well.
