# Intro to Neural Networks
-embedding artifical imge outside of manifold of natural images neural network is an embedding function of sort 

how do we learn weights in a nural network? sa we are on neuron 100, outputs final prediction, compare vs real label , compare error vs on on

how do we set weghts, well do it with [[[backpropagtion]]] prop forward tp start, and then info comes back, multivariable chain rule is neded, take derivative of thhe activation function, do partil in trrms of z, deriv of result by chai rule tells us

we propagate error since the previous error ic ahnged by the first, theres a change tbat goes down the net onvery computationally expensive, so we need everything going back, trainign takes a lot of time b oft th=e. Practically once our fucntion is succesful, the we can gradjdtpkpchoice here of 0-1 for a learning rare, goes tbe same thing, we have new weights, rinse and repeat, detre=rmjnY. networks converge s=around $ e=laye
