# Operating Systems Definition 
A computer system is made of four things, its [[hardware]], its [[Operating System]], [[Application Program]]s, and [[User]]. 

The [[hardware]] on a computer consists of its [[Central Processing Unit]], [[Memory]], and [[Input/Output Devices]]. 

[[Application Program]]s consist of word processors, spreadsheets, browsers, and everything that we would typically see, and pretty much any other application that the user would run. 

The [[Operating System]] is the thing which coordinates the way in which the [[Application Program]] uses the [[hardware]] and thereby the resources of the computer. An operating system provides the environment for programs to usefully execute and to share resources from one another, rather than.

# User Perspective on Operating Systems
The operating system serves to [[Abstract]] the underlying complexity of the system, to maximize user friendliness and ease of use. Some [[Operating System]]s are intended to run on mobile devices. 

Some [[Operating System]]s are never meant to be interacted with by the user, like those in [[Embedded Computers]].

# System Perspective on [[Operating System]]s 

OSs are extremely involved with the hardware, and are in fact the most involved with hardware. OSs are [[resource allocator]]s, and coordinate what programs receive what. We choose what programs receive what CPU time, what memory space, storage space, I/O devices. 

The [[Operating System]] is the manager of these resources. The [[Operating System]] has to deal with numerous incoming requests and tries to allocate resources to all of them.  

Another perspective on operating systems is as a control program, which stops improper use of the computer, it is interested in our use and control of OS devices.

# A true Definition of Operating Systems 
[[Operating System]]s were only born when computers stopped being single devices that could only sustain one program, but instead could be general purpose. In the 1960s, [[Moore's Law]] predicted that the number of transistors on integrated circuits would double every 18 months, nd thus computers have wildly improved. 

We can't really fully define what an OS is. It is generally hard to make single pieces of hardware do our task, so instead we opt for an OS which can coordinate a common se of tasks. Some OSs take up gigabytes, and some take up megabytes, it depends a lot upon their feature. 

A more common definition, and the one that will mostly be used is that the OS as the only program that runs throughout the entirety of the computers time on. The program that continually runs when the computer is on is known as the [[Kernel]]. 

There are also [[system programs]], which are related to the kernel but not a part of it. 

Many modern mobile operating systems have [[middleware]], which are a set of software frameworks made for developers.
