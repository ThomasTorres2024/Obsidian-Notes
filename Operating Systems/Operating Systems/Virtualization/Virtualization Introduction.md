The [[Operating System]] provides [[Abstract]]ion to the underlying hardware in our computer. Processors become [[Thread]]s, Memory becomes [[Address Space]]s, [[DIsk]]s and [[SSD]]s become files, [[Networks]] become [[Sockets]], and Machines become [[Processeses]]. 

The [[Operating System]] is an "Illusionist", it removes software and hardware quirks reducing complexity. OSs also optimize for us as well.
