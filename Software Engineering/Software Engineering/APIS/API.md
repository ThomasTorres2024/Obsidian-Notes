The API s an application programming interface. It is a standard way for different applications to communicate with one another. [[HTTP]] is the standard protocol for requesting information over the internet. We send a request over the server, and we load in the standard javascript and html for the site. There are standard requests for these operations.

Each request has an end point. We have a root endpoint, a normal website, and then some more end points. Get requests returns a representation in XML, JSON, or HTTP response code of 200 (ok). 404 is not found, 400 is bad request. Websites are endpoints. 

Post requests except additional information from the user
