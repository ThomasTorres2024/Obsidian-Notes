# Git 
Git is a version control system which allows devs to manage different versions and to collaborate on their codebase without conflict. GitHub allows us to host, share, and collaborate on repos, GitHub is built around Git. 

Version control helps teams work together very efficiently, avoids conflicts, and maintain a history of changes to our projects.
