We need to be able to learn everything from the frontend, how the user interacts with our app, to the backend, how our app interfaces with servers. We need to be develop platforms that are cross platform, meaning across phones, computers etc. It needs to be able to communicate with our backend.

A frontend person works mostly with the screen and things we'd see on it like buttons.

A backend person mostly works with the server and how our interface works with the people in the backend. 

A fullstack developer is able to work in both.
