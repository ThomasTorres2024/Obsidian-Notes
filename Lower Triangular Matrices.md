# Definition
Lower triangular matrices are [[matrices]] in $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ where each $a_{ij} =0$ when $i<j$. Typically, lower triangular matrices are square matrices in the wild. The product of two lower triangular matrices is lower triangular. 

#### Facts about Upper Triangular Matrices 
The only matrices which are [[Upper Triangular Matrix]] and [[Lower Triangular Matrices]] are [[diagonal matrix]] (diagonal matrices). The [[Inverse Matrix]] of a lower triangular matrix is another lower triangular matrix.
