# Independence of [[Random Variables]]
Given [[Random Variables]] $X,Y$, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if:
$$\mathbb{P}[X \leq x, Y \leq y] =  \mathbb{P}[X \leq x] \mathbb{P}[Y \leq y]$$ which holds $\forall x,y$.

In the discrete case, it is easier to work with the [[Probability Mass Function]]:
$$\mathbb{P}[X = x, Y = y] =  \mathbb{P}[X = x] \mathbb{P}[Y = y]$$
