# Probability Axioms 
Suppose we have a random experiment with a sample space $S$, and suppose we  have  $n$ elements where each $A_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$, we have that:
$$\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_{i} = S$$We have the following axioms:

### 1.) Probabilities in a [[Sample Space]] are bound between $0$ and $1$:
$$0 \leq \mathbb{P}[A_{i}] \leq 1  :  \in [1,2,3, \dots , n] \cap \mathbb{N}$$
### 2.) Probabilities in a [[Sample Space]] sum to $1$:
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}[A_{i}]=1$$

# Equally Likely Events
If two events, $E_1,$ and $E_2$ are equally likely, denote $N$ to be the "number of outcomes" in the respective space where $E$ is the [[Event (Probability)]] space and $S$ is the [[Sample Space]]. 
$$\mathbb{P}[E]= \frac{N(E)}{N(S)}$$
Intuitively we can think of this as the total number of ways that some event $E$ can occur, over the total set of all outcomes in $S$.
