The [[Vandermonde Identity]] relates the following [[Permutation]] identities:
$$\sum_{k=0}^c {a \choose k} {b \choose c-k} = {a+b \choose c}$$
It looks like we are just adding the coefficients in our choice formulas. We can think of our choice formula for $a$ choose $k$ as choosing $k$ items from a set of $a$ total items without caring about the order in which we chose them. The same intuition can be applied for $b$ choose $c-k$. 

Intuitively, we are taking a total of $c$ items each time. We are choosing $a$ of one amount, and $b$ of another. We then consider the sum of all possible orders of taking items from both $a$ and $b$, which in total gives us the total number of ways that we can take from sets $a$ and $b$ when we extract $c$ items.
