If we are taking items from a set $A$, sampling with replacement would put withdrawn items back into $A$, and thus the [[probability]] of drawing an $a \in A$ would be constant. However, when we do [[Sampling Without Replacement]], withdrawing $a \in A$, will alter our probability of drawing subsequent items $a \in A$. 

A distribution that make use of this fact is the [[Hypergeometric Distribution]], which is a generalization of the [[Binomial Distribution]].
