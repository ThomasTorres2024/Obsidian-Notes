# First Derivative Test 
The [[First Derivative Test]] is a test which uses the [[derivative]] of a function, $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, allows us to find the [[local minima]] and [[local maxima]] of $f$. 

We can find all of the points where $f'(x)=0$. The points here would either consist of [[local minima]], [[local maxima]], or a [[Saddle Point]]. 

We can then use the [[Second Derivative Test]] in order to determine the [[Concavity]] of the function $f$ at its optima. This allows us to determine if an optima is a [[Saddle Point]], a [[Local Minima]], or a [[Local Maxima]].
