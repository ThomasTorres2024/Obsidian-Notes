# Programming Language
There are multiple forms of programming languages. The first generation of programming languages are essentially machine native code that consists of direct instructions for the CPU to make when carrying out tasks on a machine. The second generation of programming languages consist of [[Assembler]]. [[Assembler]] provides a level of abstraction to programmers by allowing certain operations that are performed at a low level to be abstractly represented with syntax and written by a human programmer. 

The third generation of programming languages is an abstraction of assembler. These languages abstract the operations of assembler into language that is much closer to English, making code a lot easier to write. Some examples of this include [[Python]], [[Dart]], [[Java Script]], etc.
