# Object Oriented Programming
[[Object Oriented Programming]] is a paradigm for developing programs which makes use of classes. A class can be instantiated into an object. Classes have methods and data. Methods manipulate the data. The data is conveniently grouped into the class container and helps us as a programmer by being able to easily access its contents. 

It is not directly a programming language, because we can implement classes on top of existing [[Functional Language]]s, [[Fundamentals of Programming Languages/Languages Overview/Programming Language]]s, and [[Imperative Language]]s.
