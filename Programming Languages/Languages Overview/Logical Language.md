# Logical Language 
A [[Logical Language]] is a [[Programming Language]] which is constructed by essentially constructing a large set of facts. During execution, we check to see if a fact is true or if it lines up with our expectations, and we are able to evaluate output from that. Examples of [[Logical Language]]s include Prolog.
